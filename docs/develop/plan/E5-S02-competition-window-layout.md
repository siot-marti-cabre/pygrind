## Status

## Estimate

## Description
[PCT] The main competition screen that wires all UI widgets together into a functional workspace: problem panel on the left, code editor on the right, output panel below the editor, timer at the top, and Run/Submit buttons. This is where users spend their entire 3-hour session.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Problem panel occupies left side (30-40% width)
- [ ] Code editor occupies right side (60-70% width) with Run/Submit buttons below
- [ ] Output panel below the editor (collapsible or resizable)
- [ ] Timer widget prominently at the top center
- [ ] QSplitter allows user to resize panels
- [ ] Ctrl+Enter triggers Submit from anywhere in the editor

## Tasks
- **T1: Implement CompetitionWindow** — Create ui/competition.py. Use QSplitter for left/right. Nest vertical QSplitter for editor/output on right side. Add QToolBar or button bar with Run/Submit.
- **T2: Wire widget connections** — Connect Run/Submit buttons to handler methods. Connect SessionManager.problem_updated to UI refresh. Connect TimerController.tick to TimerWidget.update_time.
- **T3: Add keyboard shortcut** — QShortcut(QKeySequence('Ctrl+Return'), self, submit_action). Verify it works when editor has focus.

## Technical Notes
- QSplitter preserves user's panel sizes during session. Initial splitter ratio: 35/65 left/right.
- Button bar: Run (test sample) | Submit (test all) | separate from editor toolbar.
